Task 1: Biological Sequence Retrieval and Analysis
Internship: CodeAlpha – Bioinformatics Internship

PROCESS:

1. The protein sequence of Hemoglobin Subunit Beta (Human) was retrieved from the UniProt database.
2. The UniProt ID P68871 was searched using the UniProt web interface.
3. The protein sequence was downloaded in FASTA format and saved as protein_sequence.fasta.
4. The retrieved sequence was submitted to ExPASy ProtParam for basic protein analysis.
5. Physicochemical properties of the protein were analyzed and recorded.

TOOLS USED:
- UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org)
- ExPASy ProtParam (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/)

RESULTS:

Protein Name: Hemoglobin Subunit Beta
Organism: Homo sapiens
UniProt ID: P68871
Sequence Length: 147 amino acids
Protein Type: Globular protein
Primary Function: Oxygen transport in red blood cells
Stability Index: Stable protein
Theoretical pI: Physiologically suitable for RBC environment
