CodeAlpha Bioinformatics Internship Task 1 - Protein Sequence Analysis using BLAST

This repository contains the work completed for Task 1: DNA/Protein Sequence Analysis
as part of the CodeAlpha Bioinformatics Internship Program

Objective
-To analyze a protein sequence using NCBI BLAST and identify homologous sequences.

Tools Used
 -NCBI BLAST (BLASTp)
 -UniProt Database

Sequence Details
- Protein Name: Hemoglobin Subunit Beta
- Organism: Homo sapiens
- UniProt ID: P68871

Methodology
1. Downloaded protein sequence from UniProt in FASTA format.
2. Performed BLASTp analysis using NCBI BLAST.
3. Analyzed sequence similarity and alignment results.

Result

-High sequence similarity and low E-value confirmed accurate protein identification.

Conclusion

-This task improved understanding of sequence analysis using bioinformatics tools.

Acknowledgment

-Completed as part of the CodeAlpha Bioinformatics Internship task 1 DNA/Protein Sequence Analysis using BLAST with help of CodeAlpha team and i learn about Understanding the FASTA Format and how to use biological sequence data . Using NCBI BLAST For Protein Sequence analysis. Identifying homologous sequence . Interpreting percent Identity, Query Coverage, And E-value . Reading and analyzing BLAST result Correctly. Gaining hands-on experience with bioinformatics tools
